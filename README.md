# reactCodeLouisvilleProject
This is the repository for my react Code Louisville Project

This is a very basic react app utilizing [Create React App], ReactDom, ReactBootstrap, and Browse Router.  

Clicking on the different pages will route you to another page.

The home page is just has basic information on the application

The About page says a little bit more about the about page

The API page connects to a basketball Page where the user can select a season, and team, and find out the roster for that team during the year

the And More! current features a search API

It still needs a ton of work in regards to functionality, but it shows off react and writing to the dom.  Further enhancements would include future enhancements include a way to search for players, and find a list of teams they have been on.
